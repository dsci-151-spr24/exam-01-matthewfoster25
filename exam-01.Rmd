## Rules

1.  Your solutions must be written up in the R Markdown (Rmd) file called `exam-01.Rmd`.
    This file must include your code and write up for each task.
    Your "submission" will be whatever is in your exam repository at the deadline.
    Commit and push the Rmd and the md outputs of that file.

2.  This exam is open book, open internet, closed other people.
    You may use any online or book based resource you would like, but you must include citations for any code that you use (directly or indirectly).
    You **may not** consult with anyone else about this exam other than the Professor or TA for this course.
    You cannot ask direct questions on the internet, or consult with each other, not even for hypothetical questions.

3.  You have until **[DUE DATE]** to complete this exam and turn it in via your personal Github repo - late work will **not** be accepted.
    Technical difficulties are **not** an excuse for late work - do not wait until the last minute to knit / commit / push.

4.  Each question requires a (brief) narrative as well as a (brief) description of your approach.
    You can use comments in your code, but do not extensively count on these.
    I should be able to suppress **all** the code in your document and still be able to read and make sense of your answers.
    See the first setup code chunk in your Rmd file to experiment with suppressing and revealing your code.

5.  Even if the answer seems obvious from the R output, make sure to state it in your narrative as well.
    For example, if the question is asking what is 2 + 2, and you have the following in your document, you should additionally have a sentence that states "2 + 2 is 4."

``` r
2 + 2
# 4
```

1.  You may only use `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` (and its dependencies) for this assignment. Your solutions may not use any other R packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## Academic Integrity Statement

*I, Matthew Foster, hereby state that I have not communicated with or gained information in any way from my classmates or anyone other than the Professor or TA during this exam, and that all work is my own.*

**A note on sharing / reusing code:** I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
For this exam you are allowed to make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).
You are also not allowed to ask a question on an external forum, you can only use answers to questions that have already been answered.
Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
All communication with classmates is explicitly forbidden.

## Getting help

You are not allowed to post any questions on the public community repo or the public questions channel on Slack.
Any questions about the exam must be asked in person in office hours or on Slack via direct message to the Professor or the TAs.
For quickest response we recommend that you start a direct message with the Professor and all the TAs so that whoever gets to it first can respond to you.

## Grading and feedback

The total points for the questions add up to 90 points.
The remaining 10 points are allocated to code style, commit frequency and messages, overall organization, spelling, grammar, etc.
There is also an extra credit question that is worth 5 points.
You will receive feedback as an issue posted to your repository, and your grade will also be recorded on Sakai.

## Logistics

Answer the questions in the document called `exam-01.Rmd`.
Add your code and narrative in the spaces below each question.
Add code chunks as needed.
Use as many lines as you need, but keep your narrative concise.

Before completing, make sure to supress the code and look over your answers one more time.
If the narrative seems sparse or choppy, edit as needed.
Then, revert back to revealing your code.

Don't forget that you will need to configure your user name and email for Git to be able to push to your repository.

## Packages

In addition to `tidyverse`, you will need the `nycflights13` package for the data.
You will first need to install these packages and then load them.

## The data

The `nycflights13` package contains information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in 2013.
The main data is in the `flights` data frame, but there are additional data sets which may help understand what causes delays, specifically:

-   `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
-   `planes`: construction information about each plane
-   `airports`: airport names and locations
-   `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

## Questions

1.  **Question 1 (10 points)** - What are the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of fligts heading to each airport.
    
**Answer:**
The Table below shows the ten most common destinations for flights from NYC airports in 2013 with Chicago O'Hare International Airport as the most frequent with 17,283 flights and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport rounding out the top 10 with 9,705 flights.

*I used https://nobleaircharter.com/airport-codes-usa/ to show me the corresponding airport to airport code.*
    
```{r}
#| label: top_ten_destinations
#| eval: TRUE

library(nycflights13)

destination_freq <- table(flights$dest)
top_ten_destinations <- sort(destination_freq, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
top_ten_table <- data.frame(Destination = names(top_ten_destinations), Frequency = as.vector(top_ten_destinations))
print(top_ten_table)

```

*Used information from Lab04 to show myself how to sort by frequency.*

2.  **Question 2 (10 points)** - Which airlines have the most flights departing from NYC airports in 2013?
    Make a table that lists these in descending order of frequency and shows the number of flights for each airline.
    In your narrative mention the names of the airlines as well.
    *Hint:* You can use the `airlines` dataset to look up the airline name based on `carrier` code.
    
**Answer:**
The Table below shows the airlines with the most frequent departures from NYC airports in 2013. Number one is UA (United Air Lines Inc.), two is B6 (JetBlue Airways), 3 is EV (ExpressJEt Airlines Inc.), four is DL (Delta Air Lines Inc.), 5 is AA (American Airlines Inc.), 6 is MQ (Envoy Air), 7 is US (US Airways Inc.), 8 is 9E (Endeavor Air Inc.), 9 is WN (Southwest Airlines Co.), 10 is VX (Virgin America), 11 is FL (AirTran Airways Corporation), 12 is AS (Alaska Airlines Inc.), 13 is F9 (Frontier Airlines Inc.), 14 is YV (Mesa Airlines Inc.), 15 is HA (Hawaiian Airlines Inc.), and 16 is OO (SkyWest Airlines Inc.).

```{r}
#| label: airline_freq
#| eval: TRUE

airline_freq <- table(flights$carrier)
sorted_airline_freq <- sort(airline_freq, decreasing = TRUE)
airline_table <- data.frame(Airline = names(sorted_airline_freq), Frequency = as.vector(sorted_airline_freq))
print(airline_table)

```

3.  **Question 3 (10 points)** - Consider only flights that have non-missing arrival delay information.
    Your answer should include the name of the carrier in addition to the carrier code and the values asked.

    a\.
    Which carrier had the highest mean arrival delay?
    
**Answer:**
The carrier with the highest mean arrival delay of 21.9207 minutes is F9 (Frontier Airlines Inc.).

```{r}
#| label: highest_mean_arrival
#| eval: TRUE

non_missing_arrival_delay_flights <- flights[!is.na(flights$arr_delay), ]

mean_arr_delay <- tapply(non_missing_arrival_delay_flights$arr_delay, non_missing_arrival_delay_flights$carrier, mean)

highest_mean_delay_carrier <- names(mean_arr_delay)[which.max(mean_arr_delay)]

highest_mean_delay_value <- max(mean_arr_delay)

cat("Carrier with the highest mean arrival delay:", highest_mean_delay_carrier, "(Mean delay:", highest_mean_delay_value, "minutes)\n")

```

    b\.
    Which carrier had the lowest mean arrival delay?
    
**Answer:**
The carrier with the lowest mean arrival day at -9.930889 minutes is AS (Alaskan Airlines Inc.).

```{r}
#| label: lowest_mean_arrival
#| eval: TRUE

lowest_mean_delay_carrier <- names(mean_arr_delay)[which.min(mean_arr_delay)]

lowest_mean_delay_value <- min(mean_arr_delay)

cat("Carrier with the lowest mean arrival delay:", lowest_mean_delay_carrier, "(Mean delay:", lowest_mean_delay_value, "minutes)\n")


```

*Used information from weekly lecture notes (week 4) to remind myself how to catgorize(cat) two columns of a dataset.*

4.  **Question 4 (10 points)** - What was the mean temperature at the origin airport on the day with the highest departure delay?
    Your answer should include the name of origin airport, the date with the highest departure delay, and the mean temperature on that day.
    
**Answer:**
The day with the highest departure delay was January 9th, 2013 and it occured at JFK (NY Kennedy) Airport. The temperature on this day was 42.66  degrees Fahrenheit. 
     
```{r}
#| label: temp_delay_day
#| eval: TRUE

flight_with_highest_delay <- flights[which.max(flights$dep_delay), ]

year <- flight_with_highest_delay$year
month <- flight_with_highest_delay$month
day <- flight_with_highest_delay$day

weather_on_date <- weather[weather$origin == flight_with_highest_delay$origin & weather$year == year & weather$month == month & weather$day == day, ]

mean_temp_origin <- mean(weather_on_date$temp)

cat("Date with the highest departure delay:", format(as.Date(paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")), "%Y-%m-%d"), "\n")
cat("Origin airport:", unique(flight_with_highest_delay$origin), "\n")
cat("Mean temperature on that day:", round(mean_temp_origin, 2), "degrees Fahrenheit\n")

```

*Used Chapter 13 of R for Data Science to answer Question 4.*

*Used Chapter 17 of R for Data Science to help change my cat for date from 15714 to a proper Year-Month-Date format.*

5.  **Question 5 (15 points)** - Consider breaking the day into four time intervals: 12:01am-6am, 6:01am-12pm, 12:01pm-6pm, 6:01pm-12am.

    a\.
    Calculate the proportion of flights that are delayed at departure at each of these time intervals.
    
**Answer:**
The following table shows that at the interval of 12:01am-6:01 am there is a 20.7% chance of delay, at the interval of 6:01am-12pm there is a 26& chance of delay, at the interval of 12:01pm-6pm there is an interval of 46.3% chance of delay, and at the interval of 6:01pm-12am there is a 52% chance of delay.
   
```{r}
#| eval: TRUE
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#| label: flights-time-interval
#| eval: TRUE

flights <- flights %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = case_when(
    sched_dep_time >= 001  & sched_dep_time <= 600  ~ "12:01am-6am",
    sched_dep_time >= 601  & sched_dep_time <= 1200 ~ "6:01am-12pm",
    sched_dep_time >= 1201 & sched_dep_time <= 1800 ~ "12:01pm-6pm",
    sched_dep_time >= 1801                          ~ "6:01pm-12am"
  ))

flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%
  mutate(dep_delayed = ifelse(dep_delay > 0, "delayed", "ontime")) %>%
  count(time_of_day, dep_delayed) %>%
  group_by(time_of_day) %>%
  mutate(prop_delayed = n / sum(n)) %>%
  filter(dep_delayed == "delayed") %>%
  arrange(prop_delayed)
```

*Used Chapter 18 of R for Data Science along with notes from previous lesson to understand mutation and dplyr functions.*

    b\.
    Comment on how the likelihood of being delayed change throughout the day?
    
**Answer:**
The later in the day the flight is, the more likely the flight is to be delayed.

6.  **Question 6 (15 points)** - Find the flight with the longest air time.
   
    a\.
    How long is this flight?
    
**Answer:**
The length of this flight was 695 minutes or 11 hours and 35 minutes.

*Used calculator to divide 695 into hours.*
    
```{r}
#| label: longest-air-time
#| eval: true

longest_airtime_flight <- flights[which.max(flights$air_time), ]

longest_flight_duration <- longest_airtime_flight$air_time

print(longest_flight_duration)
```

    b\.
    What city did it fly to?
    
**Answer:**
This flight went to Honolulu, Hawaii.
    
```{r}
#| label: longest-air-time-city
#| eval: true

destination_city <- longest_airtime_flight$dest

print(destination_city)
```

    c\.
    How many seats does the plane that flew this flight have?

**Answer:**
The plane that flew this flight was plane N77066 which has 292 seats.

```{r}
#| label: longest-air-time-seats
#| eval: true

plane_tailnum <- longest_airtime_flight$tailnum

print(plane_tailnum)
```

7.  **Question 7 (15 pts)** - The `airports` data frame contains information on a large number of primarily American airports.
    These data include location information for these airports in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates.
    In this question we limit our focus to the [Contiguous United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States).
    Visualize and describe the distribution of the longitudes of airports in the Contiguous United States.
    What does this tell you about the geographical distribution of these airports?
    *Hint:* You will first need to limit your analysis to the Contiguous United States.
    [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States) can help, but you're welcomed to use other resources as well.
    Make sure to cite whatever resource you use.
    
**Answer:**
The northernmost point in the contiguous states is Northwest Angle Inlet in Lake of the Woods, Minnesota at (Lat) 49°23′04.1″N (Lon) 95°9′12.2″W.

The southernmost point in the contiguous states is Ballast Key, Florida at (Lat) 24°31′15″N (Lon) 81°57′49″W .

The easternmost point in the contiguous states is Sail Rock, Lubec, Maine at (Lat) 44°48′45.2″N (Lon) 66°56′49.3″W.

The westernmost point in the contiguous states is Bodelteh Islands, offshore from Capa Alava, Washinton at (Lat) 48°10′42.7″N (Lon) 124°46′18.1″W
    
*Used both wikipedia links provided; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States.*

**Answer:**
The following histogram shows that there is the greatest number of airports between the longitude of -90 and -80. Other longitudes with a greater number of airports include -75, -100, and -125.

```{r}
#| eval: TRUE
#| message: false

library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
#| label: airports-contiguous-us
#| eval: true

northern_boundary <- 49.3845
southern_boundary <- 24.5208
eastern_boundary <- -66.9476
western_boundary <- -124.7717

contiguous_us_airports <- airports %>%
  filter(lat <= northern_boundary & lat >= southern_boundary &
         lon <= eastern_boundary & lon >= western_boundary)

ggplot(contiguous_us_airports, aes(x = lon)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Airports Within the Contiguous United States",
       x = "Longitude", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

*Used Chapter 9 of R for Data Science to remind me how to make a histogram.*

8.  **Question 8 (15 pts)** - Recreate the plot included below using the `flights` data.
    Once you have created the visualization, in no more than one paragraph, describe what you think the point of this visualization might be.
    *Hint:* The visualization uses the variable `arrival`, which is not included in the `flights` data frame.
    You will have to create `arrival` yourself, it is a categorical variable that is equal to `"ontime"` when `arr_delay <= 0` and `"delayed"` when `arr_delay > 0`.

**Answer:**
This visualization shows on-time flights of New York City during December of 2023 with destinations to PJL and RDU airports. The purpose of this may be to compare which airport destination experiences a greater number of delays.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-plot
#| eval: true

flights %>%
  filter(month == 12, dest %in% c("PHL", "RDU")) %>%
  mutate(arrival = ifelse(arr_delay > 0, "delayed", "ontime")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(arrival)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = arrival, y = dep_delay, color = dest)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(dest ~ origin) +
  labs(title = "On-time Performance of NYC Flights",
       subtitle = "December 2013",
       x = "Arrival",
       y = "Departure Delay",
       color = "Destination")
```


![](img/plot-to-recreate.png)

*Used R for Data Science Chapters 1 and 4 to figure out what type of ggplot2 graph it is and how to define it.*

**Extra Credit (5 pts)** - Create a visualization that effectively shows if there is a relationship between the average daily departure delay and the average daily temperature for all three New York city airports.
Your answer must be given in a single pipe.
(You should only spend time on this question once you have finished answering the others)

**Answer:**
After Posit crashed three times trying to complete this question, I felt it best not to do it.

*Used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_in_the_New_York_metropolitan_area#:~:text=Kennedy%20International%20Airport%20(JFK)%2C,refer%20to%20these%20three%20airports. to learn which airports are in New York City.*
